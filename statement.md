# Problem Statement:
In our busy daily life, we often don't notice 
how our mood and habits like sleep, study, exercise, 
and water intake affect us. Since most people
don't keep any record, it becomes difficult
to understand their patterns and make improvements.

# Scope of the Project:
This is a simple, single-user, console-based
Python program that allows a user to record 
daily mood and habits and view a basic weekly
report. It doesn't include advanced features 
like a GUI or database, but those can be added
later.

# Target Users:
This project is useful for students and anyone 
who wants to understand better their daily routine 
and improve their lifestyle.

# High-Level Features:
Users can add daily records, view saved data,
see average values, find their most common
mood, and get small suggestions for
improvements.
